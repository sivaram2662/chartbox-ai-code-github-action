OpenAI as your “brain” for all the dialog management, intent/slot extraction, follow up questions, language handling, even validation, and use RAG only to fetch property data (plus your Redis/Mongo for memory and your BraveAPI for web fallbacks). The trick is to wire everything together with OpenAI’s function calling feature. Here’s how that looks end to end:
________________________________________
1. Define Your Functions for the LLM
In your code (Node.js, Python, whatever), register a small set of functions that the model can call:
[
  {
    "name": "extract_intent_and_slots",
    "description": "Parse user message to identify intent, fill slots (action, category, type, location, budget).",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "intent": { "type": "string", "enum": ["property_query", "general_info", "fallback"] },
        "slots": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "action": { "type": ["string", "null"], "enum": ["buy", "rent", null] },
            "category": { "type": ["string", "null"], "enum": ["residential", "commercial", null] },
            "type": { "type": ["string", "null"], "enum": ["flat", "villa", "plot", "house", null] },
            "location": { "type": ["string", "null"] },
            "budget_min": { "type": ["number", "null"] },
            "budget_max": { "type": ["number", "null"] }
          },
          "required": []
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "fetch_properties",
    "description": "Query Pinecone + Mongo for matching property listings based on filled slots.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "slots": { "$ref": "#/properties/slots" }
      },
      "required": ["slots"]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "search_web",
    "description": "Fetch real estate info from whitelisted sites if internal data isn’t enough.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "query": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["query"]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "save_memory",
    "description": "Persist updated slot values or user preferences to Redis/Mongo.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "session_id": { "type": "string" },
        "slots": { "$ref": "#/properties/slots" },
        "language": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["session_id", "slots"]
    }
  }
]

2. The Chat Loop
1.	You receive a user message (text or Whisper transcript).
2.	First API call: send everything to the model with:
o	Your system prompt (instructions about asking missing slot questions, language preference, no hallucinations, etc.)
o	A single user message
o	functions: [...] containing the definitions above
o	function_call: "auto"
3.	Model responds by:
o	Calling extract_intent_and_slots with its JSON payload
4.	Your code reads that function call result, updates Redis session, and checks for missing slots.
o	If slots remain, you prompt the model again with something like:
The user’s slots are now: {…}. 
Missing: [category, type]. 
Please ask for the next missing slot.
o	If all slots are filled, call fetch_properties.
5.	Model calls fetch_properties({ slots: {...} }).
6.	Your code actually queries Pinecone + Mongo, returns the top 5–10 listings back into the chat as the function_response.
7.	Model then synthesizes a final user facing reply (“Here are 7 flats in Bangalore under ₹1 Cr…”)
8.	Optional: if function_response was empty or insufficient, the model might instead call search_web, then re run the RAG prompt, and finally answer.
9.	After generating the reply, you call save_memory to persist the updated slots and preferences.

3. Why This Works
•	OpenAI handles: intent detection, slot filling, smart question generation, response synthesis, even language translation and voice style consistency—so you don’t write that logic yourself.
•	Your code handles: function invocation (DB queries, cache reads/writes, web searches), and feeds the results back into the LLM.
•	RAG is purely for retrieving the actual property data (vector search + metadata filters)—everything else is orchestrated by the LLM.

4. System Prompt Snippet
You are MyHomi AI, an expert Indian real estate assistant.
1. Always ask for missing info in this order: buy/rent, residential/commercial, flat/villa/plot/house, location, budget.
2. Once all slots are filled, return property matches by calling fetch_properties.
3. If internal data is insufficient, call search_web.
4. Do not hallucinate. If you truly can’t find data, say “I’m sorry, no matches found.”
5. Respect the user’s language preference.
